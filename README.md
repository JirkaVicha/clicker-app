Up-Down_clicker app.

This app is like a little game where you can count up and down by clicking buttons. There's a number on the screen, and you can increase it by clicking a plus sign, decrease it by clicking a minus sign, and reset it back to zero with a cool refresh icon. It's a fun way to keep track of things or just play around with numbers!
